Order…{p=0.1} order is the basis of existence.

The reason the world spins at exactly the speed it does, the reason why physics is a science and not just a question.

We, as humans, have our own order. We have rules, laws, regulations to say yes to certain things and no to others.

But what if order fails? What if chaos seeps into the perfect constitutions that govern our lives? The chaos of greed, malice?{p=0.1} Of humanity?

Does one cling to order? Hope that by continuing it, it will return? Even if it can cost some… {p=0.2}everything?

show j surprised
j_whisper “Oh great, a newbie…”

j “Hello Mr. (playername). Courtney, this is Mr. (playername). He will be your lawyer.”
show c crying
p “Oh, Courtney, er, how are you doing?”
c “... {i}sniffle.{\i}”
p “That’s, um, great! I-”
j “Mr. (playername), can I pull you to the side for a second?”
p “Sure, that’s completely fine, Mr. …?”
j “Case. Justin Case. I am Courtney’s father.”
p “Mr. Case! Can I call you Justin?”
show j serious
j “Mr. (playername), if I may take a wild guess, it appears that you don’t seem to be a very experienced lawyer?”
p “How’d you know? This is my first case!” 
j_whisper “So we have a rookie as our defense, wonderful.”
p “Huh? I didn’t hear you.”
j “Nothing!{p=0.3} Say, if this is the first trial you are participating in, this will be a very new experience to you, yes? Well, my mother, Chlo Z. Case, was a judge.”
j “I’ll be frank, from my experience watching her perform trials… This case isn’t looking too good.”
p “It isn’t?”
show j surprised
j “Haven’t you seen the evidence? Wait, you truly haven’t?”
p “I, er{p=0.1}, kind of was just assigned to the case with no warning this morning.”
j_whisper “Damn, this isn’t looking too good.”
j “Let’s just say that the evidence is stacked against us, and if I have to admit something to you…”
j “{i}Sigh{\i}...{p=0.2} nevermind. Forget it. But Courtney deserves saving, and you aren’t very experienced.”
j “I am not a licensed practitioner, but I know how the courts work. So I ask you this: let me advise you.”
p “What?!”
j “Me and Courtney will have to be at the defense’s bench with you. When you’re there, I’ll be able to give you advice. I saw it happen all the time with senior practitioners and youths such as yourself.”
p “I-Thanks! In truth, I’m not really sure I will be able to do as well as you would like…”
show j smile
j “Kid, I’ve seen miracles happen at the bench before, battles of wit so great that they would be spoken of for years. In this world, even the impossible becomes possible.”
show j worried
j_whisper “Though even the impossible may not be enough…”

**Transition-Fade to Courtroom

ju “Order in the court! We are here for the trial of Courtney Case. 
ju “She is charged with accounts of theft, ___, and ___, to which she has pleaded not guilty.”
p “{i}Those charges wouldn’t get you too harsh of a punishment, especially for a minor…{\i}” 
show j worried
p “{i}so why does Mr. Case look so worried?{\i}”
ju “May the prosecution say its opening statement?”
pr “””
Your gracious honor, and members of the jury.

We are here, for another cut and dry case, I hope. It breaks my heart, to see the youths of this generation be so misguided, to perform such acts.
 
The prosecution has gathered various pieces of evidence to support its claims. With them, it is clear that young Ms. Case has committed the various crimes she is accused of. 

The prosecution will also be able to provide motivation as to why Ms. Case has committed the crimes she has. It is a sorry story, and I hope that after this trial, Ms. Case gets the help that she needs.

ju “Thank you. Will the defense give its opening statement?”
p “Ah, yes,{p=0.1} the opening statement! {i}I don’t have an opening statement prepared! What do I do? {\i}”
j “Psst. I can see that you don’t know what to do. I’d suggest looking at the {color=#DFC57B}documents{\color} in your possession. 
p “{i}Oh! The case files! They can help me come up with something on the fly!{\i}”
p “This case is indeed a tragic one, but not because Ms. Case is the criminal! She is in fact a victim of, um,{p=0.06} the poor security of…”
p “{i}Where did she steal from-, I mean get accused of stealing from, again…? Wait! I just read it in the {color=#DFC57B}documents{\color}! {\i}”

		j “What are you doing!? It’s mistakes like this that sway the court against you”

j_whisper “Hm. Implying that a theft indeed did happen without knowing all the details, could come to regret that. Bad phrasing as well, even if it does shift the blame from Courtney. {i}Sigh.{\i}”
p “{i}Is he rating my response? Looks like I didn’t do well…{\i}”
p “Members of the jury, I ask you to carefully consider her case! She, like all children, has great potential, which would be wasted by whatever punishment inflicted on her. She is merely…”
