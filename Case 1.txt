Order… order is the basis of existence.

The reason the world spins at exactly the speed it does, the reason why physics is a science and not just a question.

We, as humans, have our own order. We have rules, laws, regulations to say yes to certain things and no to others.

But what if order fails? What if chaos seeps into the perfect constitutions that govern our lives? The chaos of greed, malice? Of humanity?

Does one cling to order? Hope that by continuing it, it will return? Even if it can cost some… everything?

p “Sure, that’s completely fine, Mr. …?”
j “Case. Justin Case.”
p “Mr. Case! Can I call you Justin?”
show j serious
j “Mr. (playername), if I may take a wild guess, it appears that you don’t seem to be a very experienced lawyer?”
p “How’d you know? This is my first case!” 
j_whisper “So we have a rookie as our defense, wonderful.”
p “Huh? I didn’t hear you.”
j “Nothing!{p=0.3} Say, if this is the first trial you are participating in, this will be a very new experience to you, yes? Well, my mother, Chlo Z. Case, was a judge.”
j “I’ll be frank, from my experience watching her perform trials… This case isn’t looking too good.”
p “It isn’t?”
show j surprised
j “Haven’t you seen the evidence? Wait, you truly haven’t?”
p “I, er{p=0.1}, kind of was just assigned to the case with no warning this morning.”
j_whisper “Damn, this isn’t looking too good.”
j “Let’s just say that the evidence is stacked against us, and if I have to admit something to you…”
j “{i}Sigh{\i}...{p=0.2} nevermind. Forget it. But Courtney deserves saving, and you aren’t very experienced.”
j “I am not a licensed practitioner, but I know how the courts work. So I ask you this: let me advise you.”
p “What?!”
j “Me and Courtney will have to be at the defense’s bench with you. When you’re there, I’ll be able to give you advice. I saw it happen all the time with senior practitioners and youths such as yourself.”
p “I-Thanks! In truth, I’m not really sure I will be able to do as well as you would like…”
show j smile
j “Kid, I’ve seen miracles happen at the bench before, battles of wit so great that they would be spoken of for years. In this world, even the impossible becomes possible.”
show j worried
j_whisper “Though even the impossible may not be enough…”
