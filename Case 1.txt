Order...{p=0.1} order is the basis of existence.

The reason the world spins at exactly the speed it does, the reason why physics is a science and not just a question.

We, as humans, have our own order. We have rules, laws, regulations to say yes to certain things and no to others.

But what if order fails? What if chaos seeps into the perfect constitutions that govern our lives? The chaos of greed, malice?{p=0.1} Of humanity?

Does one cling to order? Hope that by continuing it, it will return? Even if it can cost some... {p=0.2}everything?

Your gracious honor, and members of the jury.

We are here, for another cut and dry case, I hope. It breaks my heart, to see the youths of this generation be so misguided, to perform such acts.
 
The prosecution has gathered various pieces of evidence to support its claims. With them, it is clear that young Ms. Case has committed the various crimes she is accused of. 

The prosecution will also be able to provide motivation as to why Ms. Case has committed the crimes she has. It is a sorry story, and I hope that after this trial, Ms. Case gets the help that she needs.

		p "I invite you to check the closing times again."
		d "Weekday closing: 7:30 p.m. Weekend closing: 7:00 p.m. On any day with a Major Sale, store closes instead 15 minutes later."
		p "Now, read the line at the very top."

pr "Have you interacted with her much? If so, how would you judge her personality?"
r "I rarely spoke with her. She was very quiet throughout, almost suspiciously quiet. I never quite understood why she would come to the store every day, even when it was visibly so obvious that she could not afford even the cheapest of my wares.
pr "When did the incident occur, and where were you at the time?"
r "It was after the store closed. I was packing up my personal items from my office and walking out when I witnessed the incident."
